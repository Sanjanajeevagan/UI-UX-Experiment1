# UI-UX-Experiment1



```
AIM:

To understand and explore the fundamentals of User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design through practical activities, distinguish between UI and UX using real-world examples, analyze their interrelationship, and gain hands-on experience with common UI/UX design tools.


Algorithm:

a. Explore the fundamentals of UI and UX
Study definitions, principles, and goals of UI and UX design.

Research best practices and the role each plays in digital product design.

Watch beginner tutorials or attend workshops.

b. Differentiate between UI and UX using real-world case studies
Select 2–3 popular digital products (e.g., Google, Amazon, Instagram).

Analyze UI (visual elements like layout, color, typography) and UX (user flow, ease of use, accessibility).

Prepare a comparative table showing UI vs UX features for each case study.

c. Illustrate the relationship between UI and UX in design
Design a simple app or web interface (e.g., login page or food delivery screen).

Explain how UI design choices impact UX (e.g., button placement, font readability).

Create a flowchart showing how UI supports UX.

d. Demonstrate various UI/UX design tools in detail
Choose 2–3 popular tools such as:

Figma

Adobe XD

Sketch

Balsamiq

Explore the features: wireframing, prototyping, collaboration.

Design a sample screen using each tool.

Compare ease of use, feature sets, and interface of each tool.
 


Output:

A written document/presentation explaining UI and UX fundamentals.

Case study report showing UI vs UX differences.

A sample app/web design highlighting the interaction between UI and UX.

Screenshots or recordings of designs made using Figma, Adobe XD, etc.

A comparison chart of design tools

Result:

Gained a clear understanding of the concepts, roles, and importance of UI and UX in product design.

Successfully differentiated between UI and UX using real-world digital products.

Understood how UI design decisions influence overall user experience.

Acquired hands-on experience with leading UI/UX tools and created sample designs.
